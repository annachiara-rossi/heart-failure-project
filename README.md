# Prediction of hospital readmission after Heart Failure hospitalization

This study aims at the prediction of patientsâ€™ risk of readmission at six months after hospital discharge following HF, as long as the identification of relevant factors towards the outcome. In particular, drug therapy information has been introduced, to state its potential significance in the explainability of readmission risk.

The data consists of a retrospective HF dataset, available for research and educational purposes to qualified requestors at PhysioNet.
